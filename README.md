Full-Stack | Systems Developer.

I'm 19 years old and Technical Computer student at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Rio Grande do Sul. I started programming with Java about 6 years ago, since then, I have improved in this language, but always studying and working with other back and front end technologies.

I currently work as a Developer at Grendene S/A, using technologies such as Java (Sprint Boot), JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL and scripting.
