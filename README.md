Full-Stack | Systems Developer.

I am 20 years old and I am a Systems Analysis and Development student at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Rio Grande do Sul. I started programming with Java when I was 13 years old, since then, I never stopped studying and improving myself in this and other back and frontend technologies.

I currently work as Backend Developer at Zenvia, using technologies such as Java (with Sprint Boot), Node (with majority TypeScript), PHP, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Redis, Kafka and Jenkins.
